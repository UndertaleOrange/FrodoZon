The Tiananmen Square protests or Tiananmen Square Incident, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident 
(Chinese: 六四事件; pinyin: liùsì shìjiàn, literally six-four incident), were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square in 
Beijing during 1989. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement 
(Chinese: 八九民运; pinyin: bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government 
declared martial law and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre 
(Chinese: 天安门大屠杀; pinyin: tiān'ānmén dà túshā), troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to 
block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands
more wounded.
